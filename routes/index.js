    `Be confident your website reaches the widest user-base possible including those with user-assistive devices, exotic accessibility preferences like AI text-to-speech events, and variable screen color and contrast  configuration.`,
    `Satiate starving search engines by feeding their algorithms exactly what they're craving in order to show-up on page-one of their search results.`,
    `Make it obvious when to share something.  And reward sharers with beautiful content previews that will entice their followers to click-through to you.`,

    `Eventually, people stop returning to boring or uninformative sources.  In the extreme, this can be a case with a brand's own website.`,
    `As unbelievable as it sounds, it is really possible to respond appropriately to every situation.  Responding appropriately should be considered normal, but with today's variety of devices all with varying view-port aspect-ratios, the potential for an awkward situation is greater today than ever before in human history.`,
    `Content creators can't keep up with how much content people consume in 2022.  For example, Many of the popular newsrooms today write with the aid of AI to keep up with demand.  More and more, visitors expect new content each and every time they visit a website.  Less and less people keep their own personal records and rather opt to defer to cloud-sources.  This behavior is observed at every level from high-end surveillance system services to bookmarking a company's contact page rather than entering their number into a local phone book—or just writing it down.`,
    `User assistive devices should be able to parse the human-readable information to broaden the base of website access to include those persons with accessibility challenges.  In the web design sphere, this is referred to as semantics or semantic design.`,
    `Search engines are the business listings of today with 31% of Americans reported to be online constantly and over 70% of Americans going online for everyday retail purchases.  Some sources estimate these percentages to be higher.  Search engine algorithms prioritize websites that:  a.) are updated frequently, and:  b.) have lots of links pointing back to the website (usually by visitor's sharing links to social media).  `,
    `You know when someone sends you a link to something of interest, and when the link comes through, either by email, text or social media dashboard, the content preview doesn't seem appropriate?  But then there are other times when the preview images and text are totally in sync.  In the twenty-first century, word of mouth happens in a virtual plaza.  With a reputation for content that shares beautifully, visitor's are more likely to reference your website in their posts.`,
    `Are you familiar with your website under the hood?  As the owner of a website, you become an author.  You don't necessarily need to be prolific to be successful, but your statement should be clear and decisive.  And it's hard to make a clear statement if you can't actually manage to get in there to sate anything.  What's the point.  Things are rarely set it and forget it!  There will be wording you'll want to massage, images you'll want to replace, and so on.`

Owners can update them anytime from virtually anywhere, keeping their content fresh.  And opportunities for visitors to share content are plentiful which distributes pointers back to your website.`,
